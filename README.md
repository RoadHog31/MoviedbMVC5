     * Including unit tests: I have used AAA Unit testing https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/unit-test-basics?view=vs-2019
     
     The AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern is a common way of writing unit tests for a method under test.

        The Arrange section of a unit test method initializes objects and sets the value of the data that is passed to the method under test.

        The Act section invokes the method under test with the arranged parameters.

        The Assert section verifies that the action of the method under test behaves as expected.
